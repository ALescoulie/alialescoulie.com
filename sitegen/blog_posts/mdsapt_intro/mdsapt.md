# MD-SAPT: A Mixed Methods Approach to Analyzing Protein Interactions

MD-SAPT is a project I started the summer before my third year of college after my internship at Arizona State University in [Oliver Beckstein's computational biophysics group](https://becksteinlab.physics.asu.edu/).
During the internship I learned a great deal both about the fundamentals of software engineering and how to develop in the open-source Python ecosystem.
I 
Those skills were what enabled me to start MD-SAPT which went on to define my work in the Computational Chemistry Group over the subsequent years of college.

The idea for MD-SAPT's mixed methods approach emerged from previous research in the group analyzing active site interactions within MD data.
Previously our group preformed MD simulations the protein MEK1, a dual-factor human kinase responsible for cell cycle regulation, and potential target for chemotherapeutics [(see this paper for more info)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00989).
That work identified key amino acids in the protein responsible for
